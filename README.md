On the Create tab, a randomly generated App name will be suggested. Either accept that default name or provide a unique name for your application. This will become part of the application URL.

#### Note: If the name is not unique, you will see an error message and you must enter a different name before you can continue.

You will need to create an IBM Cloud API key to allow the deployment process to access your resources. Click the New button to create the key. A message dialog will appear. You can accept the default values and confirm to close the dialog.Also Increase the Memory allocation per instance slider to at least 128MB. If you do not increase the memory allocation, your Node-RED application might not have sufficient memory to run successfully.

Configure the DevOps toolchain by selecting the region it should be created in. Again, try to match the region you selected previously. Click Create.

Refresh the page, the Deployment Automation section will show details of your newly created Delivery Pipeline. The Status field of the pipeline will eventually show In progress. That means your application is being built and deployed.

Click the Status field to see the full status of the Delivery Pipeline. The Deploy stage will take a few minutes to complete. You can click on the View logs and history link to check its progress. Eventually the Deploy stage will go green to show it has passed. This means your Node-RED Starter application is now running.

On the initial screen, click Next to continue. Secure your Node-RED editor by providing a username and password. If you need to change these at any point, you can either edit the values in the Cloudant database, or override them using environment variables. The documentation on nodered.org describes how to do this. Click Next to continue. Click Finish to proceed.
